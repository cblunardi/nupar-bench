The level set segmentation program tests the HyperQ and Dynamic Parallelism

To test HyperQ:
1. Run the application with --rep <num> (with num <= 32).

To increase child kernels:
1. Edit the samples.labels file
2. Each new label adds a new parent thread and effectively increases the child kernels launched. The number of child kernels launched depends on the image data and the label intensity.

How to add labels to sample.labels file:

4	<-- Label id
10	<-- Intensity range start
80	<-- Intensity range end

Number of lines in samples.labels file should be multiple of 3, following the above given tuple.
