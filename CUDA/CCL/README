Connected Component Labeling

Used for measuring HyperQ and Dyanamic Parallelism:

Increasing child kernels for Dyanamic Parallelism:
1. The numFrames Per stream creates more parent kernels which launch additional child kernels. The number of child kernels launched
is a function of the image and the spans found in the image.

2. To make the number sufficiently high launch a combination with large number of frames (8, 16) and fewer frames per stream (2,4).


Improving HyperQ performance:
1. The number of streams launched increases the HyperQ performance
2. numStreams = numFrames/ numFramesPerStream
3. To increse the streams reduce the frames per stream or increase the frames in the pgm.
